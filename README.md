# Course Project: Image Quilting For Texture Synthesis

## Problem Statement
To perform texture synthesis using image quilting.
1. Texture synthesis: Texture Synthesis is the process of algorithmically constructing a large digital image from a small digital sample image by taking advantage of its structural content.
2. Image Quilting: It is a simple image-based method of generating novel visual appearance in which a new image is synthesized by stitching together small patches of existing images

* We are implementing research paper: “Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer” by Alexei A. Efros1,2 William T. Freeman2
